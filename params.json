I'll probably add some better functionality eventually, but for now that's what it is - a simple, no thrills approach to blogging.\r\n\r\nI essentially did this for three reasons:\r\n1. I wanted to.\r\n2. WordPress, as awesome as it is, isn't as flexible as a full framework.\r\n3. As insane as it may sound, some people who I've worked for actually find WordPress confusing. The same people had no issues with this however.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, here it is. If it doesn't work, make sure you've setup a database. If not, it's probably something minor - the error messages are generally fairly descriptive. ","name":"Simplicity"}
