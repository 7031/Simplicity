          <h3>Simplicity Blog is Best Blog</h3>

<p>Simply put, Simplicity is a simple blogging system with posts, pages and authentication written in CakePHP. I'll probably add some better functionality eventually, but for now that's what it is - a simple, no thrills approach to blogging.</p>

<p>I essentially did this for three reasons:
1. I wanted to.
2. WordPress, as awesome as it is, isn't as flexible as a full framework.
3. As insane as it may sound, some people who I've worked for actually find WordPress confusing. The same people had no issues with this however.</p>

<p>So yeah, here it is. If it doesn't work, make sure you've setup a database. If not, it's probably something minor - the error messages are generally fairly descriptive. </p>
