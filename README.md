Simplicity
==========
Simplicity is quite simply a blogging system I wrote up in my spare time. It's essentially something I wrote up so I'd have something to use on HippieJoel.com that wasn't WordPress (nothing against WordPress, I just wanted my own system).

Usage
-----
I have no idea. Just download this repo and hope for the best. Of course you'll need to edit app/Config/core.php and of course setup your database (MySQL or otherwise).

Features
-------
+ Lightweight
+ Fast
+ Awesome
+ Better than everything ever

Real features
-------------
+ Supports multiple administrators
+ Posts + pages
+ Posts can be published using HTML or plain text. The choice is yours. M
+ Fast (at least my mum says it is)
+ Easy to use (once you get it running at least)

Any features it's lacking that you think it should have? Either fork this and add them or tell me and I'll add them if I think they're necessary. Keep in mind this is Simplicity - the whole point being it has the features I do need and nothing I don't - ie don't expect it to be a full blown free WordPress implentation - that's not what this is about. 

Features I'll add soon
-----------------------
+ Markdown support
+ Additional user roles
+ Comments (most likely will use Disqus)
+ An actual admin area with settings etc. Right now everything is more or less defined through the template.

Features I may add, but are not too important right now
-------------------------------------------------------
+ Categories
+ Multiple post types
+ Full theme support

On themes: Currently styling is done by editing app/View/Layouts/default.ctp. Of course, there's nothing stopping you from specifying a cusotm theme via the AppController. I may add a configurable way to do this soon. 

Categories: Reason for this not being higher is that honestly I don't see them as too important. For a blog that's written just by me, I don't see why I need to categorize everything.
